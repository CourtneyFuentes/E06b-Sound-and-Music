# E06b-Sound-and-Music

Exercise 6b for my C220 class at IUB. Using Audacity I recorded my dog barking and arguing with me to make 3 .wav files, which I then added to my project in Godot as AudioStreamPlayer nodes. I also used MuseScore to create a piece of music to make an Ogg Vorbis Audio file, which I then added to my project in Godot as an AudioStreamPlayer node. They will play one after the other.
